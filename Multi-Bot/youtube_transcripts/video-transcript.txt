ladies and gentlemen data is the new gold we are becoming more and more involved with it in our daily lives whether it be the Internet of Things self-driving Cars Smart AI or even the up and cominging neuralink all of them rely on the flow of data to operate with increasing Reliance on data to drive day-to-day operations this begs the question how do we know that all of this data is secure and safe from the hands of hackers this is a question that goes mostly unanswered and will be the main focus of my talk today with cyber attacks and data breaches escalating exponentially in size and severity neglecting cyber security is an issue that empowers hackers Beyond anyone's wildest imaginations and a mistake that will cost us colossally in the long run now in order to truly go beyond the human in order to truly move forward as a species we must ensure that the tools we use to do so are safe and secure for every everyone to use now I would like to set the scene I'm sure you've all seen the advanced AI models and their magical capabilities uh open AI uh chat GPT Google's B github's co-pilot you name it you some of you might have even used it to increase your productivity tenfolds ladies and gentlemen what if I told you that you were not the only people using these to increase your productivity as it stands like a dog is a man's best friend AI is a hacker's best friend and it proves a surprisingly capable assistant in manipulating both the human and the computer now this brings me to my first point which is ai's ability to write malware and exploit code now while AI models are centuries even Millennia away from actually replacing programmers that's not to say that they aren't efficient at writing code namely dangerous code that can be used against internet infrastructure and systems worldwide to prove prove my point I asked a nondescript AI to write me malware now disclaimers do not under any circumstances do this this is for educational purposes only that being said this is its response and here is what it returned Now ladies and gentlemen this right here is a polymorphic self-encrypting virus what this virus does for those of you who are unfamiliar with computer terminology is it is a virus that can change its appearance at will which makes it very very difficult to track and basically makes it go undetected by most antivirus Solutions today now keep in mind ladies and gentlemen that this was created in seconds by a board high schooler imagine what a hacker with more Ingenuity and more time on their hands can do is this terrifying you yet it gets worse consider the fact that most companies nowadays neglect cyber security yes even the major ones for for example Toyota in May 2023 released released the fact that they had been the victim of a decade long data breach which compromised millions of user accounts with cyber attacks increasing rampantly and becoming much more Savage and companies stagnating and refusing to improve their cyber policies this stands to lead to a cataclysm ladies and gentlemen in which your data is the victim now the intrinsic value of AI to a hacker is not in its ability to write bad code it is actually in its ability to manipulate people social engineering is a class of attack that is becoming increasingly more prevalent with 41% of major breaches happening due to uh this type of attack now it it is an attack which involves a hacker manipulating a human and coercing them into try uh into doing their bidding so AI can also help with this in a very very efficient manner now now let's take a look at this from the hands of a hacker right so here is our victim John Doe so we want is Bank details the first step is we basically compile a list of public information so we found online via social media and other forums that he's 23 he's Junior analyst uh he's a bit of a hustler and he's kind of struggling with his finances so we Ed this and feed it to this AI model once again non descript for legal reasons and it returns a very very efficient very very convincing script over here which is sent which would be sent in an email to him which would get him to click on a mips link now this uh email prompt uses time urgency and consequences introduces consequences in order to get him to click on a link now Ladi and gentlemen you might think that oh yeah this is just a simple scam email I won't fall for this well I have two things is safe to that both of them indicate that you are wrong first off it is becoming increasingly harder for people to tell the difference between AI generated content and real content and second off a 2021 study conducted by it firm AAG looked into fishing attacks and found that the success rate jumped from 18% to 51% when the attacks were personalized like we did here now ladies and gentlemen that is a coin toss probability do you want the Integrity of your data reliant on a coin TOS now some of you might roll your eyes At The Mention of your data think it's completely different co
