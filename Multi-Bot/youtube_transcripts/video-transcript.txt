Hello, friends! This is a story from 1996. Psychologist Ashis
Nandy was doing research. For this, he spoke to Narendra Modi. Ashish Nandy's interview of Narendra Modi, went on for many hours. And when this interview ended, Ashish Nandy was shaken to his core. What did he find out about Narendra
Modi's mentality that blew his mind? In the last video, I talked about the image of Narendra Modi shown
to you on WhatsApp and media. The fake image that is created for you. In today's video, friends, let's learn about his real life. What is his real personality and his real mentality? Those who still support Narendra Modi, are going to be shocked drastically. Friends, before beginning this video,

Let's start with his childhood again. Narendra Modi studied at Bhagavatacharya Narayanacharya School. His Sanskrit teacher Prahlad Patel said that he was an average student. His biographer Nilanjan
Mukhopadhyay said the same thing. But here's something interesting. He loved to act in school plays. But if he didn't get the main role, he would refuse to act in that play. He came in contact
with RSS at the age of 8. In the year 1958, on Diwali, he became a child volunteer,
in the Vadnagar's RSS branch. His school classmate Sudhir Joshi said that after school in the evening, he would drop off his books at home and go to the RSS office. After this, in 1972, at the age of 22, Narendra Modi became the Pracharak in RSS. And 15 years later, in 1987, he was brought to BJP. He was seen as an
amazing organiser. As Andy Marino writes in his
political biography on Narendra Modi, during the 1990 Ram Rath Yatra, Narendra Modi was a part of Gujarat BJP. He played a key role in
organising the Gujarat part of the Yatra. In 1995, he was appointed as
the National Secretary of BJP. "During elections, people vote to elect the government, or they vote to change the government, but now, there's a new ideology, 'Vote to Punish.'" In 2001, he was appointed
as the Chief Minister of Gujarat. In 2002, riots broke out. After the riots, Narendra Modi
was accused of many charges. We can make a detailed video about it, but eventually, he gets a clean chit. Since then, the branding of
'Communal Narendra Modi' began. An unwavering Hindu Narendra Modi, who is against all Muslims. Now, there will be some of you who believe this branding, who believe that Narendra
Modi is this communal person. But on the other hand,
there will be some of you who consider Narendra
Modi to be a secular man. That Narendra Modi believes
in the development of all. It doesn't matter which category you are in. People of both categories will be
surprised to hear what happens next. Though Narendra Modi makes a lot of noise
about mutton and fish in his speeches, "They enjoy cooking mutton during Sawaan." on the other hand, he takes donations from
Halal Beef Exporting Companies through electoral bonds. The person who was actually
concerned about River Ganga, Swami Sanand, made four demands to make
Ganga free from pollutants. He wrote three letters to PM Modi. RTI revealed that the
letters had reached the PMO. But they got no response. When he passed away due
to 111 days of hunger strike, PM Modi couldn't ignore him any longer, and through Twitter, he expressed condolences. Being a Hindu, was he not worried
about leading a monk to his de@th? And what can we say about the farmers who keep committing su!cide. Aren't they Hindus? What did he do for those Hindus? In Prajwal Revanna's videos, more than 2,900 women were
seen being se*ually exploited. There were many Hindu
women among them. The female wrestlers protesting
against Brij Bhushan Singh, were also Hindus. What about them? "Any person, no matter how influential, if they play with a woman's dignity, It should be unforgivable." PM Modi was asking people
to vote for Prajwal Revanna and now he gave the election's
ticket to Brij Bhushan Singh's son. "NDA's Prajwal Revanna, every vote for him, will provide strength to Modi." Now, there is a section of
brainwashed people in our country who don't care about these things. They don't care if their
female relatives are safe or not, if their children are getting
proper education or not, if there's employment or not. They just want Muslims
to be in greater distress. And to convince th
